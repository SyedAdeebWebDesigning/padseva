At PadSeva, we are dedicated to eradicating period poverty and promoting menstrual hygiene in rural communities across southern India. Founded with a mission to provide access to affordable, biodegradable sanitary pads, we strive to empower individuals by addressing the critical yet often overlooked issue of menstrual health. Our innovative bamboo-made pads, created through our personal project initiative, have reached thousands of women and girls, ensuring they can manage their periods with dignity.

Since our inception, we have distributed over 7,500 pads, reaching more than 9,000 individuals while raising awareness and driving conversations around menstruation. With education and community engagement at the heart of our efforts, PadSeva not only provides essential resources but also promotes understanding and advocacy for gender equality. Join us in our journey to create a world where menstrual health is a right, not a privilege.
